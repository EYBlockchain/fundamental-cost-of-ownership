# Summary 

Blockchain technology is touted by many as the be-all-end-all solution for the digital transfer of value. Volatility in the price of major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ether, accompanied by a wave of institutional investments primarily from the banking industry, has continued to fuel widespread participation in a market once dominated and controlled by cryptographers and engineers. Today, solutions are being built to experiment with payments, supply chain management and provenance, identity management, property rights and post-trade settlement.

Public blockchains, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, enable collaboration and permission-less access to an assortment of products and services. Contrarily, private blockchains are developed and operated within controlled environments and with permissioned access, sacrificing valuable network effects, but allowing for more privacy.

Despite the technologyâ€™s popularity, particularly as it relates to corporate adoption, several basic questions remain unanswered at the institutional level, driving skepticism and resistance from business managers. While research and development teams at large organizations have ideated blockchain use cases, few working scalable solutions have materialized.

This paper lays the groundwork for answering one of the most important questions asked by business leaders today: what would a production-scale blockchain solution cost for my organization?

With new projects and upgrade proposals released regularly and a limited history of implementations to leverage, forecasting a reliable one-size-fits-all cost framework for a production-scale implementation is currently difficult. So, to begin answering this question, the EY Blockchain Team used data from global client proof-of-concept and pilot engagements, as well as internal platform builds, to develop a framework for understanding and forecasting the costs of a production-scale, commercial blockchain solution.
